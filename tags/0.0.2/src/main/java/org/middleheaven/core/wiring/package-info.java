/**
 * Wiring Toolbox
 * 
 * This is and automated dependency injection engine.
 * The engine is capable of resolving cyclic dependencies 
 * and can invoke by simple annotation of methods or constructors.
 * 
 * The wiring toolbox does it best at not violating the encapsulation principle
 * so direct access to fields although possible is discouraged.
