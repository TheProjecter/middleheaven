			<tr>
				<td>Services Toolbox</td>
				<td>
				<p>
					Allows for a service component oriented arquitecture for MiddleHeaven.
					A service is simply a contract (an interface). Many different implementations can exist for
					the same service. <br/>
					MiddleHeaven is in essence a service agregation. Services are activated 
					for a specific enviroment. Applications are modules, and modules are also services.
