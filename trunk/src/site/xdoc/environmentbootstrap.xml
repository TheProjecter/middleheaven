			<p>
				MiddleHeaven is based on the dependency resolution and service lookup mecanism 
				provided by the OSGi framework, namely Apache Felix.  
			</p>
			<p>
				OSGi framework is based on concept of bundle. A bundle in an aggregation of code than
				can provide services to be consumed by other bundles and/or consume services provided by other bundles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bootstrapping is the set of operations immediately done before the OSGi container is started.
				This ensures the possibility of configuring the core services before they are activated.
				At this point the Core Services are 3.
				<ul>
				<li>ContainerService provides acess to the Container object and is directly provided by the bootstrap and with no dependencies.</li>
				<li>FileRepositoryService provides acess to functionality tagged ManagedFile. The service uses information provided by Container to setup it self </li>
				<li>LoggingService provides functionally to support all required logging activities. This service relies on information profided the FileRepositoryService if persistence loggin is required </li>
				</ul>
