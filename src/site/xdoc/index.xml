				Welcome to Middleheaven, the only framework you will ever need.
			</p>
			

<p>
MiddleHeaven aims to be a full-featured business application framework with theses goals: 
<ul>
<li>Minimize all effort concerning non-functional requirements implementation.</li> 
<li>Maximize reusability of business code and logics</li> 
<li>Minimize dependency of third-party libraries (but used them under the hood) </li>
<li>Maximize extensibility</li>
</ul>

These goals are expressed by the following features:
<ul>
<li> Universal MVC : You code your logic in a totally view independent way, MiddleHeaven plugs it on Web or Desktop UI on demand.</li> 
<li> Ubiquous Data Access: Access you data from any node on the system. Let MiddleHeaven worry with the details of data consistency and database persistence. </li>
<li> Out-of-box application patterns implementations like Money and UnitOfWork </li>
</ul>
</p>
			<p>
				MiddleHeaven builds up on the concept of a service/component oriented arquitecture
				abstracting application infrastructure execution environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				MiddleHeaven is composed by a set of <a href="toolboxes.html">Toolboxes</a>; mini frameworks for specific tasks that integrate
				using configurable services
